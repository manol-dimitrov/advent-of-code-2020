Advent of Code 2020

- [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1) – Sort array, then use two pointers to walk through it
- [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2) – Nothing special...
- [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3) – Load input into grid, go through the grid/list incrementing x with right value & y with down value
- [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4) – Clean up input and transform to 2d array/list of lists, for each well formatted passport –> split on : and check all keys and values with a regex for each
- [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5) – Convert boarding passes from string to their binary number by substituting chars for 0 or 1 – this was a hunch and I brute forced working out which letter is 0 or 1
- [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6) – Nothing special...
